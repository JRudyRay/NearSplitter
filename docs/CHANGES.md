# 🔧 NEAR Splitter - Changes & Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to prepare your NEAR Splitter app for testnet deployment.

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Missing Environment Configuration**
**Problem:** No `.env.local` file existed  
**Fixed:** ✅ Created `frontend/.env.local` with proper configuration

### 2. **Hardcoded Contract IDs**
**Problem:** Hooks had `"your-contract.testnet"` hardcoded  
**Fixed:** ✅ Updated to use `getNearConfig()` from environment

### 3. **Incomplete Wallet Provider**
**Problem:** `SimpleNearProvider` had mock implementations  
**Fixed:** ✅ Implemented real contract call/view methods using wallet selector

### 4. **Missing MyNearWallet**
**Problem:** Only had Meteor, Ledger, Nightly wallets  
**Fixed:** ✅ Added `@near-wallet-selector/my-near-wallet` package

### 5. **Code Bug in page.tsx**
**Problem:** `result.near.status` typo (should be `result.status`)  
**Fixed:** ✅ Corrected the Promise.allSettled result handling

## ⚙️ What You Need to Do

### 1. Install Required Tools

**Rust** (for building the contract):
```powershell
# Download from: https://rustup.rs/
# Then add WASM target:
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

**NEAR CLI** (for deployment):
```powershell
npm install -g near-cli
```

### 2. Build the Smart Contract
```powershell
cd contracts\near_splitter
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
cd ..\..
```

### 3. Deploy to Testnet

**Quick option (creates dev account):**
```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-testnet.ps1 -DevDeploy
```

**Production option (your own account):**
```powershell
# Create account at https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/
near login
.\scripts\deploy-testnet.ps1 -AccountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet
```

### 4. Start the Frontend
```powershell
cd frontend
corepack pnpm dev
```

### 5. Test the App
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Connect your testnet wallet
3. Register storage (~0.0025 NEAR)
4. Create a circle
5. Add expenses
6. Test settlements

- Storage management prevents spam
- Input validation on all public methods

### Before Mainnet
- [ ] Professional security audit
- [ ] Extensive testnet testing with real users
- [ ] Consider adding admin/pause functionality
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Review and test all edge cases
