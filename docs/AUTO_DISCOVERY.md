# Auto-Discovery of Circles Feature

## üéØ What Changed

### Problem
- Users had to manually track circles or could lose access if they clicked the "√ó" button
- No automatic discovery of circles you're a member of
- Confusing UX: "Track" vs actual membership

### Solution
**"Your Circles" now automatically shows ALL circles you're a member of!**

## ‚úÖ Implementation

### Contract Changes (Rust)

Added new method to find all circles where an account is a member:

```rust
/// Get all circles where the given account is a member (including owned circles)
pub fn list_circles_by_member(
    &self,
    account_id: AccountId,
    from: Option<u64>,
    limit: Option<u64>,
) -> Vec<Circle> {
    let all_circles: Vec<Circle> = self
        .circles
        .iter()
        .filter(|(_, circle)| circle.members.contains(&account_id))
        .map(|(_, circle)| circle)
        .collect();
    
    paginate_vec(&all_circles, from.unwrap_or(0), limit.unwrap_or(50))
}
```

### Frontend Changes (React/TypeScript)

**Before:**
```typescript
const ownerCircles = useContractView<Circle[]>(
    near.accountId ? 'list_circles_by_owner' : null,
    near.accountId ? { owner: near.accountId, from: 0, limit: 100 } : null,
    { refreshInterval: 30_000 }
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Fetch all circles where the user is a member (including owned circles)
const memberCircles = useContractView<Circle[]>(
    near.accountId ? 'list_circles_by_member' : null,
    near.accountId ? { account_id: near.accountId, from: 0, limit: 100 } : null,
    { refreshInterval: 30_000 }
);
```

### UI Changes

1. **Removed "√ó" button** - No more accidentally removing circles from your view
2. **Auto-discovery** - All circles you're a member of appear automatically
3. **Persistent** - Circles stay in sidebar, can't be removed

## üé® User Experience

### Before
```
Your Circles
- Circle A (owned by you)        √ó
- Circle B (manually tracked)    √ó

(If you joined Circle C but didn't track it, you'd never see it!)
```

### After
```
Your Circles
- Circle A (owned by you)
- Circle B (you're a member)
- Circle C (you're a member)

(All circles automatically appear, no √ó button)
```

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Connect wallet** ‚Üí Frontend calls `list_circles_by_member(your.account)`
2. **Contract scans** ‚Üí Checks all circles for your membership
3. **Returns matches** ‚Üí All circles where you're in the `members` array
4. **Auto-displays** ‚Üí Circles appear in "Your Circles" sidebar
5. **Refreshes** ‚Üí Updates every 30 seconds automatically

## üìã What This Means

### You Can Now:
- ‚úÖ Join a circle and see it immediately
- ‚úÖ Never lose access to circles you're in
- ‚úÖ See all your circles without manual tracking
- ‚úÖ Have a clean, simple UI

### You Cannot:
- ‚ùå Remove circles from sidebar (that's actually a good thing!)
- ‚ùå Lose track of circles you joined
- ‚ùå Miss circles you're a member of

## üîß Technical Details

### Contract Query
```bash
# See all circles for an account
near view nearsplitter-5134.testnet list_circles_by_member \
  '{"account_id":"your.testnet","from":0,"limit":100}'

# Returns array of Circle objects where account_id is in members[]
```

### Performance
- **Complexity**: O(n) where n = total circles (scans all)
- **Typical**: Fast for <1000 circles
- **Optimized**: Pagination support (limit 50 default, 100 max)
- **Caching**: Client-side cache with 30s refresh interval

### Edge Cases Handled
- ‚úÖ User is owner (counts as member automatically)
- ‚úÖ User joins mid-session (appears on next refresh)
- ‚úÖ User owns multiple circles (all appear)
- ‚úÖ User is member of circles they didn't create (all appear)

## üéØ Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- **Index optimization** - Store member‚Üícircles mapping for O(1) lookup
- **Real-time updates** - WebSocket notifications when added to circle
- **Circle grouping** - Separate "Owned" and "Member" sections
- **Search/filter** - Find specific circles in long lists

## üì¶ Deployment

```bash
# Build
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Optimize
wasm-opt -Oz --signext-lowering --converge --strip-producers \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/near_splitter.wasm \
  -o contract_optimized.wasm

# Deploy (no migration needed - just adding new method)
near deploy nearsplitter-5134.testnet contract_optimized.wasm
```

## ‚úÖ Testing

1. **Test with first account:**
   - Create a circle
   - Verify it appears in "Your Circles"

2. **Test with second account:**
   - Join the circle using Circle ID
   - Wait ~30 seconds or refresh page
   - Verify circle appears automatically in "Your Circles"

3. **Test persistence:**
   - Reload page
   - All circles should still be visible
   - No way to remove them (by design!)

**Status**: ‚è≥ Contract built and optimized, waiting to deploy (RPC rate limit)  
**Once deployed**: Feature will work immediately, no frontend changes needed beyond what's already done!
