# ✅ NearSplitter Deployment Success!

## 🎉 Contract Successfully Deployed!

**Contract Address**: `nearsplitter-5134.testnet`  
**Transaction**: https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/4f9VyDqGmGe8fxbxeiwRDGmSQPtFmfhLhrPQsF2cz879

## 🔧 The Solution

The persistent "Deserialization" errors were caused by **missing WASM optimization**. NEAR contracts require proper optimization using `wasm-opt` from the Binaryen toolset.

### Build & Deploy Process

```powershell
# 1. Build the contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# 2. Optimize with wasm-opt (CRITICAL STEP!)
wasm-opt -Oz --signext-lowering --converge --strip-producers \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/near_splitter.wasm \
  -o contract_optimized.wasm

# 3. Deploy with initialization
near deploy nearsplitter-5134.testnet contract_optimized.wasm \
  --initFunction new --initArgs '{}'
```

## ✨ Fixed Issues

1. **Wallet Display** - Now shows full account name with wider box (`min-w-[200px]`)
2. **Registration Button** - Fixed to work after wallet connection
3. **Contract `#[payable]` Bug** - Added missing attribute to `storage_deposit` function
4. **WASM Optimization** - Properly optimized contract binary with wasm-opt
5. **Contract Initialization** - Successfully deployed and initialized on testnet

## 🧪 Testing the App

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Connect wallet**: Click "Connect wallet" in top right
3. **Register**: You'll see registration prompt - click "Register now" (costs ~0.0025 Ⓝ)
4. **Create Circle**: Name it (e.g., "Trip to Lisbon") and click "Create Circle"
5. **Add Members**: Add NEAR testnet accounts to your circle
6. **Add Expense**: Record who paid what and how to split it
7. **View Balances**: See who owes whom
8. **Settle**: Make payments to balance accounts

## 📋 Storage Registration

- **Cost**: 0.0025 Ⓝ (one-time)
- **Purpose**: Covers blockchain storage for your account data
- **Automatic**: Frontend handles this seamlessly

## 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **wasm-opt is mandatory** - Raw WASM from `cargo build` won't work on NEAR
2. **cargo-near would be ideal** - But requires Perl/OpenSSL on Windows (complex setup)
3. **Manual optimization works** - Download binaryen and use wasm-opt directly
4. **SDK version doesn't matter** - Both 5.1.0 and 5.17.2 work with proper optimization
5. **#[payable] is critical** - Functions accepting deposits must have this attribute

## 📦 Deployed Contract Details

```bash
# View storage bounds
near view nearsplitter-5134.testnet storage_balance_bounds
# Output: { min: '25000000000000000000000', max: '25000000000000000000000' }

# Check if account is registered
near view nearsplitter-5134.testnet storage_balance_of '{"account_id":"your.testnet"}'

# Create a circle (after registration)
near call nearsplitter-5134.testnet create_circle '{"name":"My Circle"}' \
  --accountId your.testnet --gas 150000000000000
```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

```powershell
# Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev  # Runs at http://localhost:3000

# Contract
cd contracts/near_splitter
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
wasm-opt -Oz --signext-lowering --converge --strip-producers \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/near_splitter.wasm \
  -o contract_optimized.wasm
```

## 🌐 Environment

The frontend `.env.local` is configured for testnet:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=nearsplitter-5134.testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEAR_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_NETWORK=testnet
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the full flow** - Create circles, add expenses, settle payments
2. **Invite friends** - Share the app URL and have others test it
3. **Monitor transactions** - Check testnet explorer for all activity
4. **Iterate** - Add features or fix any issues you find
