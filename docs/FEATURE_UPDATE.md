# 🎉 NearSplitter - Major Feature Update

## ✅ All Issues Fixed & New Features Added!

### Fixed Issues

1. **✓ Nested Button Hydration Error**
   - Changed circle selector from `<button>` to `<div>` with `onClick`
   - Delete button now properly nested without React hydration errors
   - Console is now clean!

2. **✓ Full Account Names Visible**
   - Removed ALL `shortenAccountId()` calls
   - Full account names now display everywhere with `break-all` CSS
   - Account names wrap properly on small screens
   - Examples:
     - Circle owner: Full name with `break-all`
     - Balances: Full account names with flex layout
     - Settlement suggestions: Full names in separate lines
     - Expenses: Full payer and participant names
     - Members list: Full names in buttons

3. **✓ Join Existing Circle Feature**
   - Improved UI with clear sections:
     - "Join Existing Circle" - Join as a member (calls `join_circle`)
     - "Track Circle (View Only)" - Just add to sidebar
   - Added helpful tip: "Ask the circle owner for the circle ID"
   - Circle ID now prominently displayed with **Copy button**
   - Format: Shows circle ID in a highlighted box at top of circle view

### 🆕 New Major Feature: Ledger Confirmation System

**The Workflow:**
1. **Add Expenses** - Members add expenses throughout the trip
2. **Confirm Ledger** - Each member confirms the expense list is correct
3. **Auto Settlement** - Once all members confirm, settlement suggestions appear
4. **Make Payments** - Use suggested transfers to settle debts

**Technical Implementation:**

#### Contract Methods (Rust)
```rust
// New field in NearSplitter struct
confirmations: LookupMap<String, Vec<AccountId>>

// New methods
pub fn confirm_ledger(&mut self, circle_id: String)
pub fn get_confirmations(&self, circle_id: String) -> Vec<AccountId>
pub fn is_fully_confirmed(&self, circle_id: String) -> bool
pub fn reset_confirmations(&mut self, circle_id: String)

// Auto-reset on new expense
// In add_expense(): self.confirmations.remove(&circle_id);
```

#### Frontend UI (React/Next.js)
- New "Confirm Expenses" section with visual progress bar
- Shows X / Y members confirmed
- Lists all confirmed account names
- "Confirm Ledger" button (changes to "✓ You have confirmed" after confirming)
- Full confirmation status: "✓ All members have confirmed! Ready for settlement."
- Real-time updates via `useContractView` hooks

#### Migration
- Used `#[init(ignore_state)]` migration to add new field to existing contract
- Deployed with `--initFunction migrate` to preserve all existing data
- Zero downtime, all circles/expenses/settlements preserved

## 🎯 How To Use

### For Circle Creators:
1. Create a circle
2. **Share the Circle ID** (click Copy button at top of circle view)
3. Wait for members to join
4. Add expenses
5. When trip ends, confirm the ledger
6. Wait for all members to confirm
7. Make settlement payments as suggested

### For Circle Members:
1. Get Circle ID from circle owner
2. Click "Join Existing Circle" and paste the ID
3. Add your expenses
4. When trip ends, review all expenses
5. Click "Confirm Ledger" to approve
6. Once all confirm, make/receive payments

## 🚀 What's Next?

Possible future enhancements:

- **Multi-currency support** - Track expenses in different currencies
- **Recurring expenses** - For ongoing group costs
- **Export to CSV** - Download expense reports
- **Circle templates** - Pre-configured splits (equal, by income, etc.)

## 📊 Performance

- Contract size: ~150KB optimized WASM
- Average gas for confirmation: ~5 TGas
- Storage cost per confirmation: Minimal (just account ID)
- UI refresh: Every 15 seconds for confirmations, 20s for balances
