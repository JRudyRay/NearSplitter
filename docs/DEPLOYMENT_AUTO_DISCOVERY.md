# ✅ Auto-Discovery Feature - DEPLOYED!

## 🎉 Success!

Contract deployed successfully: https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/tDYq4aB5i1FeBrFCWQWEBRcqdsE2zbnYU6QehVBa5wj

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Scenario 1: See Your Existing Circles
1. **Refresh the page** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Connect your first wallet**
3. **Look at "Your Circles" sidebar** → Should see all circles you own or are a member of
4. **No × button!** → Circles are permanent in your view

### Test Scenario 2: Join a Circle from Second Wallet
1. **Open the app in a different browser or incognito window**
2. **Connect your second wallet**
3. **Get the Circle ID** from your first wallet's circle (click Copy button)
4. **Paste it in "Join Existing Circle"** and click Join
5. **Wait ~30 seconds or refresh the page**
6. **Check "Your Circles"** → The joined circle should now appear automatically!

### Test Scenario 3: Verify the Missing Circle is Back
If you had a circle that disappeared when you clicked ×:
1. **Refresh the page** → It should reappear automatically
2. Or wait up to 30 seconds for the auto-refresh
3. The circle will be back in "Your Circles" sidebar!

## 🔍 What Changed

### Before
- "Your Circles" only showed circles you owned
- Had to manually track circles
- "×" button could remove circles from view
- Could lose access to circles you're actually in

### After ✨
- **"Your Circles" shows ALL circles you're a member of**
- Automatic discovery - no manual tracking needed
- **No × button** - can't accidentally remove circles
- All your circles are always visible

## 🎯 Key Features

1. **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds all circles where you're a member
2. **Persistent View**: Circles can't be removed from sidebar
3. **Real Member List**: Shows actual blockchain membership, not local tracking
4. **30-Second Refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds to catch new memberships

## 📝 Technical Details

**New Contract Method:**
```rust
pub fn list_circles_by_member(
    account_id: AccountId,
    from: Option<u64>,
    limit: Option<u64>
) -> Vec<Circle>
```

**How It Works:**
- Scans all circles on the contract
- Filters for ones where `account_id` is in the `members` array
- Returns full Circle objects with all details
- Supports pagination (default limit: 50)

**Frontend Integration:**
```typescript
const memberCircles = useContractView<Circle[]>(
    near.accountId ? 'list_circles_by_member' : null,
    near.accountId ? { account_id: near.accountId, from: 0, limit: 100 } : null,
    { refreshInterval: 30_000 }
);
```

## ✅ Verification Commands

```bash
# Test the method directly (replace with your account)
near view nearsplitter-5134.testnet list_circles_by_member \
  '{"account_id":"YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet","from":0,"limit":10}'

# Should return array of circles you're in
```

## 🎊 What This Means

You can now:
- ✅ Join circles and see them appear automatically
- ✅ Never lose track of circles you're in
- ✅ Have confidence that all your circles are visible
- ✅ Focus on using the app, not managing the UI

You cannot:
- ❌ Remove circles from view (this is intentional!)
- ❌ Hide circles you're a member of
- ❌ Lose access to circles by clicking the wrong button
