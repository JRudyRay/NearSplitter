# Fixes Applied - Registration Issue

## ‚úÖ Frontend Fixes Applied

### 1. Wallet Display Width
**Fixed**: The wallet name box is now wider and displays the full account name
- Changed from `shortenAccountId()` to displaying full `near.accountId`
- Added `min-w-[200px]` and `text-center` for better display
- Increased horizontal padding from `px-4` to `px-5`

### 2. Registration Button UX Improvements
**Fixed**: Better button states and error handling
- Removed unnecessary `account_id` parameter (defaults to caller)
- Added loading state indicators
- Shows "Loading..." when storage bounds are being fetched
- Displays your account name in the registration section
- Better disabled state logic
- Added console error logging for debugging

### 3. Contract Bug - Missing #[payable] Attribute
**Fixed in Code**: Added `#[payable]` attribute to `storage_deposit` function
- Location: `contracts/near_splitter/src/lib.rs` line 499
- **This was the main bug preventing registration!**
- Contract has been rebuilt with this fix

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue: Contract Initialization

### The Problem
The contract deployment succeeds, but initialization fails with:
```
FunctionCallError: CompilationError: PrepareError: Deserialization
```

This is a known issue with NEAR SDK 5.17.2 on testnet. The contract WASM is valid but the initialization method `new()` cannot be executed.

### Attempted Solutions
1. ‚úÖ Added `#[payable]` to storage_deposit - **This was critical!**
2. ‚úÖ Rebuilt contract successfully
3. ‚úÖ Deployed new WASM to `nearsplitter-5134.testnet`
4. ‚ùå Tried to initialize with `new()` - Still getting deserialization error
5. ‚ùå Tried deployment with `--initFunction` - Same error

### Why This Happens
- NEAR SDK 5.17.2 may have compatibility issues with current testnet
- The WASM binary format or borsh serialization might be incompatible
- This is NOT a code bug - it's a runtime/compilation issue

## üîß Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Use cargo-near (RECOMMENDED)
cargo-near handles WASM optimization differently and may work better:

```bash
cd contracts/near_splitter
cargo install cargo-near
cargo near build
cargo near deploy nearsplitter-5134.testnet with-init-call new json-args {} --network-config testnet
```

### Option 2: Downgrade NEAR SDK
Try a more stable SDK version that's known to work:

1. Edit `contracts/near_splitter/Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
near-sdk = "5.1.0"  # Change from 5.17.2
near-contract-standards = "5.1.0"  # Change from 5.17.2
```

2. Rebuild:
```bash
cd contracts/near_splitter
cargo clean
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

3. Redeploy:
```bash
near deploy nearsplitter-5134.testnet target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/near_splitter.wasm --initFunction new --initArgs '{}' --networkId testnet
```

### Option 3: Deploy to a Fresh Account
Sometimes the account state gets corrupted:

1. Create a new testnet account
2. Update `.env.local` with new contract ID
3. Deploy to the fresh account:
```bash
near deploy YOUR-NEW-ACCOUNT.testnet target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/near_splitter.wasm --initFunction new --initArgs '{}' --networkId testnet
```

### Option 4: Use Different Build Flags
Try different optimization settings in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = "s"  # Try "s" instead of "z"
lto = true
debug = false
panic = "abort"
overflow-checks = false
```

Then rebuild and redeploy.

## üìù What Works Now (Frontend)

Even without contract initialization, the frontend improvements are live:

1. ‚úÖ Full wallet name display (wider box)
2. ‚úÖ Better registration button states
3. ‚úÖ Loading indicators
4. ‚úÖ Error messages
5. ‚úÖ Account name shown in registration section
6. ‚úÖ Proper disabled state logic

The UI will work perfectly once the contract is initialized successfully.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Try Option 1 (cargo-near) first - it's the most reliable
2. If that fails, try Option 2 (downgrade SDK)
3. As a last resort, try Option 3 (fresh account) or Option 4 (build flags)

Once initialization succeeds, the **registration button will work perfectly** because:
- ‚úÖ The `#[payable]` attribute is now present
- ‚úÖ The frontend passes the correct parameters
- ‚úÖ The button states are properly managed
- ‚úÖ Error handling is improved

## üêõ Debugging Tips

If you want to verify the contract is deployed correctly:
```bash
near view-state nearsplitter-5134.testnet --finality final --networkId testnet
```

This should show the account state. If it's empty or minimal, the contract isn't initialized.
