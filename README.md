Live demo: https://jrudyray.github.io/NearSplitter/  
Contract (example): `nearsplitter-5134.testnet`
What it does
- Track shared expenses on-chain for transparency and tamper-resistance.
- Let groups ("circles") add expenses, confirm them, and compute minimal settlements.
- Built so anyone with a NEAR wallet can join and verify the ledger.
Quick start (use)
1. Open the demo: https://jrudyray.github.io/NearSplitter/
2. Connect your NEAR testnet wallet and pay the small storage fee.
3. Create or join a circle and start adding expenses.
Developer notes
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (in `frontend/`).
- Contract: Rust + near-sdk (in `contracts/near_splitter/`).

Developer & deploy notes
- Frontend: see `frontend/` (Next.js). Run `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to work locally.
- Contract: see `contracts/near_splitter/` (Rust). Build with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` and optimize the produced wasm with `wasm-opt` before deploying to NEAR. Update `frontend/.env.local` with your contract ID.
- Frontend hosting: this repo is configured to publish the frontend to GitHub Pages from `main` — check `.github/workflows/` for the workflow.
