# NearSplitter - Environment Configuration
# ===========================================
# This is the root-level environment configuration example.
# Different components have their own environment requirements.

# ===========================================
# FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ===========================================
# The frontend (Next.js) requires environment variables for NEAR integration.
# See: frontend/.env.local.example for the full frontend configuration template.
#
# Quick setup for frontend:
#   cd frontend
#   cp .env.local.example .env.local
#   # Edit .env.local with your values
#
# Required variables:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID    - Your deployed NEAR contract account ID
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_NEAR_NETWORK   - Network: "testnet" or "mainnet"
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_NEAR_RPC_URL   - (Optional) Custom RPC endpoint

# ===========================================
# CONTRACT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ===========================================
# The smart contract (Rust) does NOT use environment variables at runtime.
# Configuration is done via:
#   1. Build-time: Cargo.toml settings
#   2. Deploy-time: near-cli deployment commands
#   3. Runtime: Contract initialization parameters

# ===========================================
# DEPLOYMENT SCRIPTS
# ===========================================
# PowerShell deployment scripts may use environment variables:
#
# NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID - Your NEAR account for deployment (optional)
#   Example: export NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account.testnet
#
# Note: Most deployment is done via near-cli which uses its own credential system.
# See: ~/.near-credentials/ for stored accounts

# ===========================================
# CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
# ===========================================
# GitHub Actions workflows use built-in secrets and environment variables:
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN (automatic)
#   - Committed: frontend/.env.production (for GitHub Pages deployment)
#
# No additional secrets configuration required for current workflows.

# ===========================================
# DEVELOPMENT
# ===========================================
# For local development, you typically only need:
#   1. Frontend env vars (see frontend/.env.local)
#   2. NEAR CLI credentials (near login)
#   3. Rust toolchain (rustup, wasm32 target)
#
# See COMMANDS.md for complete setup instructions.

# ===========================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ===========================================
# - NEVER commit .env.local files (these are gitignored)
# - frontend/.env.production is committed (public testnet config only)
# - For mainnet: Use environment variables in hosting provider, not committed files
# - All NEAR transactions are public on-chain (no secret keys in env vars)
# - Private keys managed by NEAR CLI in ~/.near-credentials/
